INTRODUCTION                              *projectlocal-vim* *projectlocal*

Load your vim project configurations safely, for vim and neovim. Written in
typescript via |denops.vim|.

CONFIGURATION                                        *projectlocal-config*

Below are the default configurations, which must be defined before the plugin
is loaded by your plugin manager:

Vimscript
>
    let g:projectlocal = {
        \ 'showMessage': v:true,
        \ 'projectConfig': '.vim/init.vim',
	\ 'debug': v:false,
        \ }
<

Lua
>
    vim.g.projectlocal = {
        showMessage = true,
        projectConfig = '.vim/init.vim',
	debug = false,
    }
<

To get started, create the local config in your project root. The simplest
way is to call `:PLConfig` which will create the file as defined in
`g:projectlocal.projectConfig` filepath. You can also manually create the
file.

Start making changes into the file that is project specific and on the next
reload of vim/nvim, it will prompt you to accept the file to be sourced.

Note: Whenever you change your local config file, projectlocal will prompt you
to accept the changes before it will be sourced. Refer to the README.md
on the repo https://github.com/creativenull/projectlocal-vim

COMMANDS					    *projectlocal-commands*

				*:PLConfig*
PLConfig			Open the project local config file, if it
				exists.

				*:PLAutoloadEnable*
PLAutoloadEnable		Enable auto sourcing, if it was disabled.
				This means on the next time you open vim
				and the local project config has changed
				then it will ask the user to allow sourcing
				the file. If there were no changes on the
				local project config file then source it
				automatically.

				*:PLAutoloadDisable*
PLAutoloadDisable		Disable auto sourcing, if it was enabled.
				This means the next time you open vim then
				it will not automatically source the local
				project config file, but can manually load
				the file via |:PLLoad|.

				*:PLLoad*
PLLoad				Manually source the local project config
				file if autoload is disabled.
