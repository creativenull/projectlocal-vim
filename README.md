Load your vim project local configurations safely, for vim and neovim. Written in typescript for [denops.vim][denops].

This is a combination of my [projectcmd.vim][pcmdvim] and [projectcmd.nvim][pcmdnvim] plugins with the aim to unify both
plugins to support both vim and neovim.

__Status: Alpha (Still testing the waters with denops but use at your own discretion ðŸ˜ƒ)__

## TODO

+ [ ] Ability to integrate certain plugins, like ALE, editorconfig, etc
+ [X] Add example gifs/videos
+ [X] Command to create local config file
+ [X] Add more commands, abbreviations if necessary

## Examples
### Running for the first-time

Here is an example of setting up a first time use with projectconfig-vim. In the video below, an ALE linter is set up
for linting the project. This will prompt projectlocal-vim to accept the new local config file and source it.

### Running after a change

Here is an example of setting up after a change was made in the local config file. In the video below, an ALE fixer is
set up for formatting files in the project. This will prompt projectlocal-vim to accept the changes before re-sourcing
it.

## Requirements

+ [deno](https://deno.land)
+ [denops.vim][denops]
+ Vim 8.2 and up (check `:version`)
+ Neovim 0.4.4 and up (check `:version`)

## Install

First follow the guide to [install deno](https://deno.land) in your machine. Then follow instructions below to install
the plugin via vim-plug, packer.nvim or any plugin manager that's similar to vim-plug.

### vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'vim-denops/denops.vim'
Plug 'creativenull/projectlocal-vim'
```

### packer.nvim

```lua
use {'creativenull/projectlocal-vim', requires = {'vim-denops/denops.vim'}}
```

## Overview
### Why

If you've used `set exrc` for setting project-level local configurations before, then you would know that using it might
pose a risk where malicious code can be executed if downloading unknown projects from git repos with an `.exrc` in that
directory, see [`:h 'exrc'`][vim-exrc]. Therefore, you would also be informed to also enable `set secure` to disable
some vim options to prevent the execution of such code, see [`:h 'secure'`][vim-secure].

However, there might some options you may want to conditionally set on a project-level basis but the limitations of
`secure` restrict you from setting those options. Some of these options include:

+ autocmds
+ shell commands
+ write commands

**projectlocal-vim** tries to tackle this by not using `set secure` or `set exrc` but by sourcing your project-level
local configurations in a safe manner.

### How it works

What this means is that when you open a project for the first time, and **projectlocal-vim** detects a project config
in the project directory, it will then prompt you to allow the local config to be sourced along with your vim config.
Once you've accepted it, it will remember the project directory and will load the local configuration the next time you
open vim in that project directory.

This plugin will also not execute your local config, if you've made changes to the local config file after permitting it.
This means, that **projectlocal-vim** will again prompt you to accept the changes and re-source the local config file.
It's designed to make sure any changes should go through the user first before sourcing it.

Essentially, the goal of this plugin is to help you safely source your local configurations in a project.
Think of it like an `.vscode/settings.json` file but for vim/neovim and written in vimscript or Lua. This gives you and
your team more control on how to set vim configurations on the project and not mess with your user configurations.

[Revised from projectcmd.nvim]

## Getting Started

To get started, just install the plugin and add a `init.vim` to you project directory into the location:
`$PROJECT/.vim/init.vim` (where `$PROJECT` is your project directory). This will automatically be picked up by
projectlocal-vim and will prompt you to be allowed to be sourced for the first time.

If you don't want to automatically source the file after opening vim and want to opt to manually source it, then first
allow local config file to be loaded first and then run `:PLAutoloadDisable` to disable it only for that
project directory.

### Configuration

Default configurations are as follows and must be defined BEFORE your plugins are loaded via your plugin manager:

```vim
let g:projectlocal = {
    \ 'showMessage': v:true, " (Default) Show messages on the command line on what the plugin is doing
    \ 'projectConfig': '.vim/init.vim', " (Default) Project config file, located in project root path
    \ 'debug': v:false, " (Default) Enable debug mode
    \ }
```

Or in a `init.lua`:

```lua
vim.g.projectlocal = {
    showMessage = true, -- (Default) Show messages on the command line on what the plugin is doing
    projectConfig = '.vim/init.vim', -- (Default) Project config file, located in project root path
    debug = false, -- (Default) Enable debug mode
}
```

## Commands

Below are the available commands for use:

+ `:PLConfig` - Open the project local config file, if it exists, else create it and then open it.
+ `:PLAutoloadEnable` - Enable auto sourcing, if it was disabled. This means on the next time you open vim and
    the local project config has changed then it will ask the user to allow sourcing the file. If there were no changes
    on the local project config file then source it automatically.
+ `:PLAutoloadDisable` - Disable auto sourcing, if it was enabled. This means the next time you open vim then
    it will not automatically source the local project config file, but can manually load the file via `:PLLoad`.
+ `:PLLoad` - Manually source the local project config file if autoload is disabled.
